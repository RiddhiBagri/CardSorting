# CardSorting

You are given a deck of cards numbered from 1 to n. The cards are shuffled randomly and all cards are visible. You are allowed only one move operation. MoveCard(n) which moves the card of value n up to the top of the pile.

Program to sort the pile of cards with the minimum number of MoveCard operations. The number of cards should lie in the range 1-10.

The program is written in JAVA.
Input to the program is the number of cards and the Initial state (after the cards are shuffled).
Both the inputs are validated to ensure teh input is numbers only and number of cards(n) lie in the range 1-10 inclusive. And the Initial state of cards contain only numbers from 1 to n.

The program then processes the input and finds the largest card number from which the cards needs to be moved up to the top of the pile so that the pile of cards is sorted with the minimum number of MoveCard operations.
